## Implementations

  - [php](http://github.com/everzet/jade.php)
  - [scala](http://scalate.fusesource.org/versions/snapshot/documentation/scaml-reference.html)
  - [ruby](http://github.com/stonean/slim)

## Installation

via npm:

    npm install jade

## Browser Support

 To compile jade to a single file compatible for client-side use simply execute:
 
    $ make jade.js

 Alternatively, if uglifyjs is installed via npm (`npm install uglify-js`) you may execute the following which will create both files.
 
    $ make jade.min.js

## Public API

```javascript
    var jade = require('jade');

    // Render a string
    jade.render('string of jade', { options: 'here' });

    // Render a file
    jade.renderFile('path/to/some.jade', { options: 'here' }, function(err, html){
	    // options are optional,
	    // the callback can be the second arg
    });

    // Compile a function
    var fn = jade.compile('string of jade', options);
    fn.call(scope, locals);
```

### Options

 - `scope`     Evaluation scope (`this`)
 - `self`      Use a `self` namespace to hold the locals. _false by default_
 - `locals`    Local variable object
 - `filename`  Used in exceptions, and required when using includes
 - `debug`     Outputs tokens and function body generated
 - `compiler`  Compiler to replace jade's default

## Syntax

### Line Endings

**CRLF** and **CR** are converted to **LF** before parsing.

### Tags

A tag is simply a leading word:

    html

for example is converted to `<html></html>`

tags can also have ids:

    div#container

which would render `<div id="container"></div>`

how about some classes?

    div.user-details

renders `<div class="user-details"></div>`

multiple classes? _and_ an id? sure:

    div#foo.bar.baz

renders `<div id="foo" class="bar baz"></div>`

div div div sure is annoying, how about:

    #foo
    .bar

which is syntactic sugar for what we have already been doing, and outputs:

    `<div id="foo"></div><div class="bar"></div>`

### Tag Text

Simply place some content after the tag:

    p wahoo!

renders `<p>wahoo!</p>`.

well cool, but how about large bodies of text:

    p
      | foo bar baz
      | rawr rawr
      | super cool
      | go jade go

renders `<p>foo bar baz rawr.....</p>`

interpolation? yup! both types of text can utilize interpolation,
if we passed `{ locals: { name: 'tj', email: 'tj@vision-media.ca' }}` to `render()`
we can do the following:

    #user #{name} &lt;#{email}&gt;

outputs `<div id="user">tj &lt;tj@vision-media.ca&gt;</div>`

Actually want `#{}` for some reason? escape it!

    p \#{something}

now we have `<p>#{something}</p>`

We can also utilize the unescaped variant `!{html}`, so the following
will result in a literal script tag:

    - var html = "<script></script>"
    | !{html}

Nested tags that also contain text can optionally use a text block:

    label
      | Username:
      input(name='user[name]')

or immediate tag text:

    label Username:
      input(name='user[name]')

Tags that accept _only_ text such as `script`, `style`, and `textarea` do not
need the leading `|` character, for example:

      html
        head
          title Example
          script
            if (foo) {
              bar();
            } else {
              baz();
            }

Once again as an alternative, we may use a leading '.' to indicate a text block, for example:

      p.
        foo asdf
        asdf
         asdfasdfaf
         asdf
        asd.

outputs:

        <p>foo asdf
        asdf
          asdfasdfaf
          asdf
        asd
        .
        </p>

This however differs from a leading '.' followed by a space, which although is ignored by the Jade parser, tells Jade that this period is a literal:

    p .
    
outputs:

    <p>.</p>

### Comments

Single line comments currently look the same as JavaScript comments,
aka "//" and must be placed on their own line:

    // just some paragraphs
    p foo
    p bar

would output

    <!-- just some paragraphs -->
    <p>foo</p>
    <p>bar</p>

Jade also supports unbuffered comments, by simply adding a hyphen:

    //- will not output within markup
    p foo
    p bar

outputting

    <p>foo</p>
    <p>bar</p>

### Block Comments

 A block comment is legal as well:

      body
        //
          #content
            h1 Example

outputting

    <body>
      <!--
      <div id="content">
        <h1>Example</h1>
      </div>
      -->
    </body>

Jade supports conditional-comments as well, for example:

    body
      //if IE
        a(href='http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/') Get Firefox

outputs:

    <body>
      <!--[if IE]>
        <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Get Firefox</a>
      <![endif]-->
    </body>


### Nesting

 Jade supports nesting to define the tags in a natural way:

    ul
      li.first
        a(href='#') foo
      li
        a(href='#') bar
      li.last
        a(href='#') baz

### Block Expansion

 Block expansion allows you to create terse single-line nested tags,
 the following example is equivalent to the nesting example above.

      ul
        li.first: a(href='#') foo
        li: a(href='#') bar
        li.last: a(href='#') baz


### Attributes

Jade currently supports '(' and ')' as attribute delimiters.

    a(href='/login', title='View login page') Login

Boolean attributes are also supported:

    input(type="checkbox", checked)

Boolean attributes with code will only output the attribute when `true`:

    input(type="checkbox", checked= someValue)
    
Multiple lines work too:

    input(type='checkbox',
      name='agreement',
      checked)

Multiple lines without the comma work fine:

    input(type='checkbox'
      name='agreement'
      checked)

Funky whitespace? fine:


    input(
      type='checkbox'
      name='agreement'
      checked)

Colons work:

    rss(xmlns:atom="atom")

Suppose we have the `user` local `{ id: 12, name: 'tobi' }`
and we wish to create an anchor tag with `href` pointing to "/user/12"
we could use regular javascript concatenation:

    a(href='/user/' + user.id)= user.name

or we could use jade's interpolation:

   a(href='/user/#{user.id}')= user.name

The `class` attribute is special-cased when an array is given,
allowing you to pass an array such as `bodyClasses = ['user', 'authenticated']` directly:

    body(class=bodyClasses)

### Doctypes

To add a doctype simply use `!!!`, or `doctype` followed by an optional value:

    !!!

Will output the _transitional_ doctype, however:

    !!! 5

or

    !!! html

or

    doctype html

doctypes are case-insensitive, so the following are equivalent:

    doctype Basic
    doctype basic

Will output the _html 5_ doctype. Below are the doctypes
defined by default, which can easily be extended:

```javascript
    var doctypes = exports.doctypes = {
	    '5': '<!DOCTYPE html>',
	    'xml': '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>',
	    'default': '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">',
	    'transitional': '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">',
	    'strict': '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">',
	    'frameset': '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Frameset//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-frameset.dtd">',
	    '1.1': '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">',
	    'basic': '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML Basic 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/xhtml-basic11.dtd">',
	    'mobile': '<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//WAPFORUM//DTD XHTML Mobile 1.2//EN" "http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/DTD/xhtml-mobile12.dtd">'
	};
```

To alter the default simply change:

```javascript
    jade.doctypes.default = 'whatever you want';
```

## Filters

Filters are prefixed with `:`, for example `:markdown` and
pass the following block of text to an arbitrary function for processing. View the _features_
at the top of this document for available filters.

    body
      :markdown
        Woah! jade _and_ markdown, very **cool**
        we can even link to [stuff](http://google.com)

Renders:

       <body><p>Woah! jade <em>and</em> markdown, very <strong>cool</strong> we can even link to <a href="http://google.com">stuff</a></p></body>

Filters may also manipulate the parse tree. For example perhaps I want to
bake conditionals right into jade, we could do so with a filter named _conditionals_. Typically filters work on text blocks, however by passing a regular block our filter can do anything it wants with the tags nested within it.

    body
      conditionals:
        if role == 'admin'
          p You are amazing
        else
          p Not so amazing

Not that we no longer prefix with "-" for these code blocks. Examples of 
how to manipulate the parse tree can be found at _./examples/conditionals.js_ and _./examples/model.js_, basically we subclass and re-implement visitor methods as needed. There are several interesting use-cases for this functionality above what was shown above such as transparently aggregating / compressing assets to reduce the number of HTTP requests, transparent record error reporting, and more.

## Code

Jade currently supports three classifications of executable code. The first
is prefixed by `-`, and is not buffered:

    - var foo = 'bar';

This can be used for conditionals, or iteration:

    - for (var key in obj)
      p= obj[key]

Due to Jade's buffering techniques the following is valid as well:

    - if (foo)
      ul
        li yay
        li foo
        li worked
    - else
      p oh no! didnt work

Hell, even verbose iteration:

    - if (items.length)
      ul
        - items.forEach(function(item){
          li= item
        - })

Anything you want!

Next up we have _escaped_ buffered code, which is used to
buffer a return value, which is prefixed by `=`:

    - var foo = 'bar'
    = foo
    h1= foo

Which outputs `bar<h1>bar</h1>`. Code buffered by `=` is escaped 
by default for security, however to output unescaped return values
you may use `!=`:

    p!= aVarContainingMoreHTML

The on exception made in terms of allowing "vanilla" JavaScript, is
the `- each` token. This takes the form of:

    - each VAL[, KEY] in OBJ

An example iterating over an array:

    - var items = ["one", "two", "three"]
    - each item in items
      li= item

outputs:

    <li>one</li>
    <li>two</li>
    <li>three</li>

iterating an object's keys and values:

    - var obj = { foo: 'bar' }
    - each val, key in obj
      li #{key}: #{val}

would output `<li>foo: bar</li>`

You can also nest these!

    - each user in users
      - each role in user.roles
        li= role

When a property is undefined, Jade will output an empty string. For example:

    textarea= user.signature

when undefined would normally output "undefined" in your html, however recent
versions of Jade will simply render:

    <textarea></textarea>

## Includes

 Includes allow you to statically include chunks of Jade
 which lives in a separate file. The classical example is
 including a header and footer. Suppose we have the following
 directory structure:

     ./layout.jade
     ./includes/
       ./head.jade
       ./tail.jade

and the following _layout.jade_:

      html
        include includes/head  
        body
          h1 My Site
          p Welcome to my super amazing site.
          include includes/foot

both includes _includes/head_ and _includes/foot_ are
read relative to the `filename` option given to _layout.jade_,
which should be an absolute path to this file, however Express
and the `renderFile()` method do this for you. Include then parses
these files, and injects the AST produced to render what you would expect:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Site</title>
    <script src="/javascripts/jquery.js">
    </script><script src="/javascripts/app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Site</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my super lame site.</p>
    <div id="footer">
      <p>Copyright>(c) foobar</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Mixins

 Mixins are converted to regular JavaScript functions in
 the compiled template that Jade constructs. Mixins may
 take arguments, though not required:

      mixin list
        ul
          li foo
          li bar
          li baz

  Utilizing a mixin without args looks similar, just without a block:
  
      h2 Groceries
      mixin list

  Mixins may take one or more arguments as well, the arguments
  are regular javascripts expressions, so for example the following:

      mixin pets(pets)
        ul.pets
          - each pet in pets
            li= pet

      mixin profile(user)
        .user
          h2= user.name
          mixin pets(user.pets)

   Would yield something similar to the following html:

```html
<div class="user">
  <h2>tj</h2>
  <ul class="pets">
    <li>tobi</li>
    <li>loki</li>
    <li>jane</li>
    <li>manny</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

## bin/jade

Output html to _stdout_:

    jade < my.jade > my.html

Generate _examples/*.html_:

    jade examples/*.jade

Pass options:

    jade examples/layout.jade --options '{ locals: { title: "foo" }}'

Usage info:

    Usage: jade [options]
                [path ...]
                < in.jade > out.jade  
    Options:
      -o, --options <str>  JavaScript options object passed
      -h, --help           Output help information
      -w, --watch          Watch file(s) or folder(s) for changes and re-compile
      -v, --version        Output jade version
      --out <dir>          Output the compiled html to <dir>
