| An example of an
a(href='#') inline
| link.

form
  label Username:
    input(type='text', name='user[name]')
    p
      | Just an example of some text usage.
      | You can have <em>inline</em> html,
      | as well as
      strong tags
      | .

      | Interpolation is also supported. The 
      | username is currently "#{name}".

  label Email:
    input(type='text', name='user[email]')
    p
      | Email is currently
      em= email
      | .

  // alternatively, if we plan on having only
  // text or inline-html, we can use a trailing
  // "." to let jade know we want to omit pipes
  
  label Username:
    input(type='text')
    p.
      Just an example, like before
      however now we can omit those
      annoying pipes!.
      
      Wahoo.
